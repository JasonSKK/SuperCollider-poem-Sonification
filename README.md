Guldhornene by Adam Oehlenschläger --> Sonification in SuperCollider

Hello!

Guldhornene is one of my favourite poems by Adam Oehlenschläger
So I decided to sonificate it!

SC reads, posts the poem from the txt file word by word in real time and converts the letters to numbers (via ascii).
Chooses a random letter from every word and maps the value for frequency, pan etc. 

Hope you will like it!
Thanks!
