# SuperCollider-poem-Sonification
Guldhornene by Adam Oehlenschläger --> Sonification in SuperCollider

Guldhornene by Adam Oehlenschläger is one of my favourite poems
So I decided to sonificate it

SC reads, posts the poem from the txt file word by word in real time and converts the letters to numbers (via ascii).
Chooses a random letter from every word and maps the value for frequency, pan etc.
